/*
 * graphs are used to show relations and help in implementing social media sites
 * adjacency matrix is used to show relationship between each vertex
 * every 1 in adjacency matrix represents an edge to vertices
 * in Undirected graph we add 1 to both sides since edges are bi directional
 *
 * adjacency list is basically another way of representing graph relations
 * An ARRAY OF LINKED LISTS is called adjacency list
 * this list tells the relation of how one edge is related with entire graph instead of just other element
 * you can access all the connected edges of one edge
