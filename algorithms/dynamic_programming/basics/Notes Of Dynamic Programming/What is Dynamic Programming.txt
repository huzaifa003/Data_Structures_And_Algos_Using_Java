A dynamic programming is nothing but an optimization technique of recursion
In dynamic problem we store the values of sub problem to be used later
A sub-problem should not be solved again is the main goal of the dynamic programming

-> Consider an expression : 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1
-> Calculate its value : which  =  10
-> Add 1 to it :
-> Answer is : 11

How were you able to solve the last question so easily?
-> By remembering the value of previous expression

Recursion is simply breaking a bigger problem to smaller problem till it reaches it base value
-> Dynamic Programming is optimizing that problem by storing the results of all the sub problems
    -> It reduces the time complexity from exponential to linear

In other words:
    -> it's a technique to solve complex problems by:
        -> breaking it into smaller sub problems.
        -> solving those sub problems & storing their results.
        -> Re-Use those stored values if that sub problem occurs again.
        -> Finally using the solutions of smaller problems to build solution of complex problem.


DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING  =  RECURSION + MEMORIZATION.
